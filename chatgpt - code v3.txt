Here's an updated version of the `prorataLeavesOfTargetDate` function that does not use a List object:

```
Function prorataLeavesOfTargetDate(employeeId As Integer, targetDate As Date) As Integer

    Dim employeeProfileSheet As Worksheet, policySheet As Worksheet, employeeProfileRange As Range, policyRange As Range
    Dim employeeProfileArray() As Variant, policyArray() As Variant
    Dim currentDate As Date, activePeriodStart As Date, activePeriodEnd As Date
    Dim totalAllowedLeaves As Integer, yearsDiff As Long, proratedLeaves As Integer
    Dim i As Long
    
    Set employeeProfileSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Employee Profiles")
    Set policySheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("HR Policy")
    
    ' Fetch Employee Record from Employee Profiles using the provided employeeId
    Set employeeProfileRange = employeeProfileSheet.Range("A2:E" & employeeProfileSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row)
    employeeProfileArray = employeeProfileRange.Value
    
    ' Find the record of the employee with the provided employeeId
    Dim employeeProfile As Variant
    For i = LBound(employeeProfileArray) To UBound(employeeProfileArray)
        If employeeProfileArray(i, 1) = employeeId Then
            employeeProfile = employeeProfileArray(i, 1)
            Exit For
        End If
    Next i
    
    ' Get Active Leave Period of the Employee that includes the targetDate
    currentDate = targetDate
    activePeriodStart = employeeProfileArray(i, 4)
    Do Until activePeriodStart > currentDate
        activePeriodStart = DateAdd("yyyy", 1, activePeriodStart)
    Loop
    activePeriodEnd = DateAdd("yyyy", -1, activePeriodStart)
    
    ' Get the total leaves allowed in the current leave period using HR Policy Sheet
    Set policyRange = policySheet.Range("A2:B11")
    policyArray = policyRange.Value
        
    ' Find the total allowed leaves for the current leave period based on the years worked
    yearsDiff = Year(activePeriodStart) - Year(employeeProfileArray(i, 4))
    totalAllowedLeaves = 0
    For i = LBound(policyArray) To UBound(policyArray)
        If policyArray(i, 1) = yearsDiff Then
            totalAllowedLeaves = policyArray(i, 2)
            Exit For
        End If
    Next i
    
    ' Calculate Prorated Leaves for the current leave period for Employee
    proratedLeaves = Int((totalAllowedLeaves / 12) * (Month(currentDate) - Month(activePeriodStart) + 1))
    
    ' Return the prorata leaves
    prorataLeavesOfTargetDate = proratedLeaves

End Function
```

In this updated version, I have replaced the List object with arrays. Instead of creating a List object, the data is read into an array using the Range.Value property. Then, the same array is used to search for the employee record and to get the years worked and allowed number of days. Once the calculation is done using basic arithmetic and VBA date functions, the result is returned as before.


I apologize for the mistake earlier. Here's the VBA implementation of the `calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee` function:

```VBA
Public Function calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee(employeeId As String, leavesToApply As Variant) As Variant
    Dim employeeProfile As Variant
    employeeProfile = EmployeeProfiles(employeeId)
    Dim initialCarryOver As Integer
    initialCarryOver = employeeProfile("InitialCarryOver")
    
    ' Determine current AL period
    Dim currentDate As Date
    currentDate = MetaData("ExcelCreateDate")
    Dim yearsWorked As Integer
    yearsWorked = employeeProfile("YearsWorked")
    Dim currentPeriodStart As Date
    currentPeriodStart = WorksheetFunction.Max(employeeProfile("EmploymentStartDate"), DateAdd("m", -11, currentDate))
    Dim currentPeriodEnd As Date
    currentPeriodEnd = DateAdd("d", -1, DateAdd("yyyy", 1, currentPeriodStart))
    
    ' Calculate prorated and carry over leaves
    Dim carryOverEnd As Date
    carryOverEnd = DateAdd("m", -HRPolicy("carryOverMonths"), currentPeriodEnd)
    Dim carryOverLeaves As Integer
    carryOverLeaves = carryOverLeavesOfTargetDate(employeeId, carryOverEnd)
    Dim proratedLeaves As Integer
    proratedLeaves = prorataLeavesOfTargetDate(employeeId, currentDate)
    
    Dim ALPeriodLeavesTaken As Variant
    ALPeriodLeavesTaken = LeaveRecords(employeeId)(Array(currentPeriodStart, currentPeriodEnd))
    Dim ALPeriodCombinedLeaves As Variant
    ALPeriodCombinedLeaves = concatArrays(ALPeriodLeavesTaken, leavesToApply)
    
    Dim carryOverLeavesApplied As Integer
    carryOverLeavesApplied = 0
    Dim prorataLeavesApplied As Integer
    prorataLeavesApplied = 0
    
    Dim i As Long
    For i = LBound(ALPeriodCombinedLeaves) To UBound(ALPeriodCombinedLeaves)
        Dim currLeave As Date
        currLeave = ALPeriodCombinedLeaves(i)
        
        Dim carryOverLeavesAvailable As Integer
        carryOverLeavesAvailable = WorksheetFunction.Min(initialCarryOver + carryOverLeaves - carryOverLeavesApplied, HRPolicy("carryOverLimit"))
        Dim prorataLeavesAvailable As Integer
        prorataLeavesAvailable = HRPolicy("baseLeaves") + WorksheetFunction.Min(yearsWorked, HRPolicy("maxYears")) - 2 - prorataLeavesApplied
        
        If currLeave >= currentPeriodStart And currLeave <= currentPeriodEnd Then
            If carryOverLeavesApplied < carryOverLeavesAvailable Then
                carryOverLeavesApplied = carryOverLeavesApplied + 1
            ElseIf prorataLeavesApplied < prorataLeavesAvailable Then
                prorataLeavesApplied = prorataLeavesApplied + 1
            Else
                calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee = "No more available leaves"
                Exit Function
            End If
        End If
    Next i
    
    Dim remainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod As Integer
    remainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod = carryOverLeavesAvailable - carryOverLeavesApplied
    Dim remainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod As Integer
    remainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod = prorataLeavesAvailable - prorataLeavesApplied

    calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee = Array("remainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod", remainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod, _
        "remainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod", remainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod)
End Function
```

This implementation uses the `Variant` type for the inputs and outputs, and the `Array` function for building the output array. The function `concatArrays` (not shown) is a custom function that concatenates two input arrays.
