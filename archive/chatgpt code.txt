Here is a sample code for the `calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee()` function that you can use as a reference. Please note that this is just a sample code and may require modifications to fit your specific implementation:

```
Function calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee(empId As Integer, Optional leavesToApply As Integer) As Variant

    ' Get the relevant data from Employee Profile sheet
    Dim startDate As Date
    Dim initialCarryOver As Integer
    Dim activeYearStart As Date
    Dim activeYearEnd As Date
    Dim currentALPeriod As String
    Dim row As Integer
    Dim lastRow As Integer
    
    Set EmployeeProfile = Sheets("Employee Profiles")
    lastRow = EmployeeProfile.Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    For row = 2 To lastRow
        If EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 1) = empId Then
            startDate = EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 2).Value
            initialCarryOver = EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 3).Value
            activeYearStart = DateSerial(Year(Now()), Month(startDate), Day(startDate))
            activeYearEnd = DateSerial(Year(Now()) + 1, Month(startDate), Day(startDate) - 1)
            currentALPeriod = activeYearStart & " - " & activeYearEnd
            
            Exit For
        End If
    Next row
    
    ' Get the relevant data from HR Policy sheet
    Dim leaveEntitlementRule As Variant
    Dim carryOverRule As Variant
    
    Set HRPolicy = Sheets("HR Policy")
    leaveEntitlementRule = Application.WorksheetFunction.VLookup(Year(activeYearStart), HRPolicy.Range("B:C"), 2, False)
    carryOverRule = Application.WorksheetFunction.VLookup(Year(activeYearStart), HRPolicy.Range("D:E"), 2, False)
    
    ' Get the data from Leave Records sheet
    Dim ALPeriodLeavesTaken As Integer
    Dim ALPeriodCombinedLeaves As Integer
    
    Set LeaveRecords = Sheets("Leave Records")
    lastRow = LeaveRecords.Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    For row = 2 To lastRow
        If LeaveRecords.Cells(row, 1) = empId And LeaveRecords.Cells(row, 2) >= activeYearStart And LeaveRecords.Cells(row, 2) <= activeYearEnd Then
            ALPeriodLeavesTaken = ALPeriodLeavesTaken + DateDiff("d", LeaveRecords.Cells(row, 2), LeaveRecords.Cells(row, 3)) + 1
        End If
    Next row
    
    ALPeriodCombinedLeaves = ALPeriodLeavesTaken + leavesToApply
    
    ' Calculate remaining leaves in carry-over period and after carry-over period
    Dim carryOverLeaves As Integer
    Dim prorataLeaves As Integer
    Dim carryOverLeavesApplied As Integer
    Dim prorataLeavesApplied As Integer
    Dim RemainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod As Integer
    Dim RemainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod As Integer
    
    carryOverLeaves = carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate(empId, activeYearStart)
    prorataLeaves = Round((leaveEntitlementRule / 365) * (activeYearEnd - startDate))
    
    If DateDiff("m", startDate, activeYearStart) >= 4 Then
        RemainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod = prorataLeaves - ALPeriodCombinedLeaves
    Else
        For i = 1 To ALPeriodCombinedLeaves
            If DateDiff("m", startDate, activeYearStart) + CInt(i / leaveEntitlementRule) >= 4 Then
                Exit For
            ElseIf carryOverLeavesApplied < carryOverLeaves Then
                carryOverLeavesApplied = carryOverLeavesApplied + 1
            ElseIf prorataLeavesApplied < prorataLeaves Then
                prorataLeavesApplied = prorataLeavesApplied + 1
            Else
                MsgBox "No more available leaves"
                Exit For
            End If
        Next i
        RemainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod = (carryOverLeaves - carryOverLeavesApplied) + (prorataLeaves - prorataLeavesApplied)
        RemainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod = prorataLeaves - RemainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod - ALPeriodLeavesTaken
    End If
    
    ' Output remaining leaves
    Dim result As Variant
    
    result = Array(RemainingLeavesInCarryOverPeriod, RemainingLeavesAfterCarryOverPeriod)
    calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee = result

End Function
```

And here is a sample code for the `carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate()` function, which also depends on the `calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee()` function:

```
Function carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate(empId As Integer, certainDate As Date) As Integer

    ' Get the employee's AL period for the given date
    Dim activeYearStart As Date
    Dim lastYearEnd As Date
    Dim currentALPeriod As String
    Dim row As Integer
    Dim lastRow As Integer
    
    Set EmployeeProfile = Sheets("Employee Profiles")
    lastRow = EmployeeProfile.Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    For row = 2 To lastRow
        If EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 1) = empId Then
            activeYearStart = DateSerial(Year(certainDate), Month(EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 2)), Day(EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 2)))
            lastYearEnd = DateSerial(Year(activeYearStart) - 1, Month(EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 2)), Day(EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 2))) - 1
            currentALPeriod = lastYearEnd & " - " & activeYearStart
            
            Exit For
        End If
    Next row
    
    ' Calculate remaining leaves in carry-over period
    Dim remainingLeaves As Variant
    
    remainingLeaves = calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee(empId)
    
    If certainDate > DateSerial(Year(certainDate), Month(activeYearStart) + 4, Day(activeYearStart) - 1) Then
        carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate = 0
    ElseIf certainDate < lastYearEnd Then
        carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate = EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 3)
    ElseIf certainDate >= activeYearStart Then
        carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate = remainingLeaves(1)
    Else
        carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate = Round(EmployeeProfile.Cells(row, 3) / 365 * DateDiff("d", lastYearEnd, certainDate))
    End If

End Function
```

Again, please note that these are just sample codes and may not work exactly as is for your specific implementation. You may need to modify them to fit your specific requirements.


Sure! Here's a sample code for the `prorataLeavesOfCertainDate()` function:

```
Function prorataLeavesOfCertainDate(empId As Integer, certainDate As Date) As Integer

    ' Get the relevant data from Employee Profile sheet
    Dim startDate As Date
    Dim activeYearStart As Date
    Dim activeYearEnd As Date
    Dim lastRow As Integer
    
    With Sheets("Employee Profiles")
        lastRow = .Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
        For i = 2 To lastRow
            If .Cells(i, 1).Value = empId Then
                startDate = .Cells(i, 2).Value
                activeYearStart = DateSerial(Year(certainDate), Month(startDate), Day(startDate))
                activeYearEnd = DateSerial(Year(certainDate) + 1, Month(startDate), Day(startDate) - 1)
                Exit For
            End If
        Next i
    End With
    
    ' Get the relevant data from HR Policy sheet
    Dim leaveEntitlementRule As Integer
    
    With Sheets("HR Policy")
        lastRow = .Cells(Rows.Count, 2).End(xlUp).Row
        For i = 2 To lastRow
            If .Cells(i, 2).Value = Year(activeYearStart) Then
                leaveEntitlementRule = .Cells(i, 3).Value
                Exit For
            End If
        Next i
    End With
    
    ' Calculate the prorata leaves based on the employment start date and the active year start and end dates
    prorataLeavesOfCertainDate = Round((leaveEntitlementRule / 365) * (activeYearEnd - startDate))
  
End Function
