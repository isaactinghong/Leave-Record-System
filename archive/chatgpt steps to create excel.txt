Sure! Here are the steps to create an Excel Leave Record System and apply the code provided:

1. Open Microsoft Excel and create a new workbook.
2. Rename the default Worksheet 1 to "Leave Records" by double-clicking on the tab name at the bottom of the screen and typing in the new name.
3. Add the following headers to the first row of the Leave Records sheet: "Employee ID", "Start Date", "End Date", and "Leave Type".
4. In the second row of the Leave Records sheet, add a sample leave record for testing purposes. 
For example, "101" in column A for the employee ID, 
"2021-01-01" in column B for the start date, 
"2021-01-05" in column C for the end date, and 
"Vacation" in column D for the leave type.
5. Create a new worksheet and name it "Employee Profiles".
6. Add the following headers to the first row of the Employee Profiles sheet: "Employee ID", "Start Date", "Initial Carry-Over Leaves".
7. In the second row of the Employee Profiles sheet, 
add a sample employee profile for testing purposes. 
For example, "101" in column A for the employee ID, 
"2020-01-01" in column B for the start date, 
and "10" in column C for the initial carry-over leaves.
8. Create a new worksheet and name it "HR Policy".
9. Add the following headers to the first row of the HR Policy sheet: 
"Year", "Leave Entitlement Rule", "Carry-Over Rule".
10. In the second row of the HR Policy sheet, 
add the leave entitlement and carry-over rules for each year. 
For example, "2021" in column A for the year, 
"10" in column B for the leave entitlement rule, 
and "4 months" in column C for the carry-over rule.
11. Open the Visual Basic Editor by pressing "Alt + F11" on your keyboard.
12. In the Visual Basic Editor, insert a new module by clicking on "Insert" from the top menu and selecting "Module".
13. Copy and paste the code for the `calculateALPeriodLeavesForEmployee()` function into the new module.
14. Insert another new module by clicking on "Insert" from the top menu and selecting "Module".
15. Copy and paste the code for the `carryOverLeavesOfCertainDate()` function into the new module.
16. Insert a third new module by clicking on "Insert" from the top menu and selecting "Module".
17. Copy and paste the code for the `prorataLeavesOfCertainDate()` function into the new module.
18. Save the workbook as a macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm) to ensure that the code is saved with the workbook.
19. Test the Leave Record System by clicking on the "Check Remaining Leaves" button or the "Submit" button in the Leave Entry Form that you created.
